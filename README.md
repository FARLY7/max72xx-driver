# MAX7219/MAX7221 LED Matrix Driver

WORK IN PROGRESS.

This repository contains a platform-agnostic driver for the MXA7219 and MAX7221 LED drivers.

The functionality of this driver will be mainly focussed on the LED matrix use case, rather than seven-segment displays.

Short comings:
- Driver assumes LED matrixes are laid out in horizontal fashion.
